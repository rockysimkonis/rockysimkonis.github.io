How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
[RS] It was great. Fairly quick as I was able to reuse the previous wireframe.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
[RS] Yes, it helped so much deciding on how to format the web page.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
[RS] Of course :)
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
[RS] Section tag was a fresh one.
